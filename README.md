Blinxs
======

A micro webserver written in Python that acts as a bridge between the world and any Thingm Blink(1) devices you have connected.

There are two variants of blinxs:

* v1: wraps the blink1-tool command-line tool

* v2: wraps the Thingm blink1.py library

Both have advantages and disadvantages - see the appropriate Read Me's for further details.
